# Touhou-1-The-Highly-Responsive-to-Prayers-NES-Demake
An NES-style adaptation of the PC-98 game. 

***Touhou 1: The Highly Responsive to Prayers*** was originally released for the PC-98 by Team Shanghai Alice in 1996. Drillimation Systems, the developer best known for the *Chuhou Joutai* series, ported the game to PC in the style of an NES game using the GameMaker engine in 2020, just in time for the franchise's 25th anniversary. It is the first game in the highly popular Touhou Project series.

The game is not a danmaku shooter like its eventual sequel, but a breakout-style puzzle game where players use a yin-yang orb to flip over tiles. The reason for its different style of gameplay was the original was a 'study project' for ZUN to practice computer programming.

Reimu Hakurei, the series' mascot, was introduced in the game. The main premise is Reimu jumps into Makai or Jigoku (localized as Aether or Nether in the demake), searching for the so-called angel of death who destroyed the Hakurei Shrine. The demake expands the backstory further, with the shrine getting destroyed during a civil war in Gensokyo.

*The Highly Responsive to Prayers* wasn't known to many players until the NES demake port released. Before that, *Touhou 6: The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil* is the game that formally introduced most players to the *Touhou Project* franchise. As a result of the demake, the game is now playable on modern machines without the need to configure an emulator.
